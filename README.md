# learn-android-iguana-views-tutorial

This branch follows the android developer tutorial found at the following link:


[Build Your First Android App in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app-kotlin#0)


### Significant Deltas from Tutorial

1. Exercise 3, Step X: the default project for views has changed.
2. Exercise 4, Step 3: top layer is now a NestedScrollView in this tutorail (which contains the previous ConstraintLayout).

### Grade Kotlin Compile Directives

Information in the tutorial is out-of-date.  You need to review the latest Android documentation to see how to add 'safe args' to the project.  This will affect both the project and top-level module gradle files.
